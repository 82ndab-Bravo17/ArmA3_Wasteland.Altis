<font face='PuristaBold' size='22'>82ndAB A3Wasteland Server Rules</font> <br/>
<br/>
<font face='PuristaBold'>Rule 1.</font> No Hacking, No Glitching, No Exceptions<br/> 
<font face='PuristaMedium' size='12'>Hacking is using an external program to hack the game and gain an advantage e.g. 'Aimbot'. Hacking is an instant ban.<br/> 
Glitching does not use an external program but exploits weaknesses in the game engine to gain unfair advantage.<br/> <br/>
<br/></font>
<font face='PuristaBold'>>Rule 2.</font> No Swearing, No Abusive Behaviour<br/> 
<font face='PuristaMedium' size='12'>Abusive behaviour is not tolerated - this includes, racism, sexism, bullying, etc 
This rule applies to text chat in game and spoken comms on VON and teamspeak<br/> <br/>
<br/></font>
<font face='PuristaBold'>>Rule 3.</font> No Griefing<br/> 
<font face='PuristaMedium' size='12'>Do not grief your team-mates, do not obstruct your team-mates for stupid entertainment. Examples of this are;<br/> 
- blocking doorways, so your team-mates can't move past you<br/> 
- blocking traffic with your vehicle<br/> 
- standing on a vehicle spawn point so the vehicle will not spawn<br/> <br/>
<br/></font>
<font face='PuristaBold'>>Rule 4.</font> No Intentional Team-killing<br/> 
<font face='PuristaMedium' size='12'>Accidental team-kills happen in any game, that is different from intentional team-killing which is anti-social. Some examples;<br/> 
- team-killing to gain a vehicle over a team-mate<br/> 
- getting angry with a team-mate and shooting them<br/> <br/>
<br/></font>
<font face='PuristaBold'>>Rule 5.</font> No Spamming Global/Side Chat<br/> 
<font face='PuristaMedium' size='12'>Please keep the chatter on VON to a minimum. If you have pertinent information or a question for the admins, be concise.<br/> <br/>
<br/></font>
<font face='PuristaBold'>>Rule 6.</font> Respect the other players on the server and always comply with requests from the Admins. <br/>
<font face='PuristaMedium' size='12'>If you think that you have been unfairly treated by an Admin, please make a post in the appropriate forum on our website at www.the82ndab.net
